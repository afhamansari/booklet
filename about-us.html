            <p>
                This platform was born out of a simple idea: to create a space where readers can share, 
                discover, and connect through books. Whether you’re looking to lend a favorite novel, 
                borrow a hidden gem, or explore new reads, booklet is here to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an independent side project, it’s a reflection of my love for books and technology. 
                I hope it inspires readers to share stories, spread knowledge, and build a community of curious minds.
